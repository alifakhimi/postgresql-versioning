This package is a collection of utilities for PostgreSQL which adds a simple
'data versioning' schema to a database.  It was originally created as part of
an AJAX powered web interface to a database, which allowed the front end to
keep track of what version of the data it currently had loaded, and not need
to request new data if the version number hadn't changed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use it, first make sure your database has the pgsql procedural language
available:

    createlang plpgsql my_database

Then apply the postgresql-versioning.sql file.

    psql my_database < postgresql-versioning.sql

This will create a new schema named 'versioning' which contains the following
items:

    * A table named 'tables' which contains one row for each table you choose
      to track versions for.  It has a 'name' column which contains the table
      name, a 'version' column which contains a simple integer version number
      which is incremented whenever the data in that table changes, and an
      'updated' column containing the timestamp of the last time the data was
      updated.

    * A function called 'update_table' which is called by the triggers on the
      tables you are tracking versions for.  This function is responsible for
      updating the information in the 'tables' table.

    * A function called 'update_triggers' which automatically creates triggers
      for all the tables in your database.  This function ignores the
      'pg_catalog', 'pg_toast', and 'versioning' schemas, since it is assumed
      you don't want to version the system databases and if you tried to use
      these triggers on the 'versioning.tables' table, you would probably tear
      a hole in the space-time continuum, or at least create infinite loops of
      updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the versioning schema is available in your database, you have two options
on how to use it.

    * You can use the update_triggers function to automatically setup the
      appropriate triggers on all of your tables (assuming you want to track
      versions for all of them).

        SELECT * FROM versioning.update_triggers();

    The select will return a list of the tables the triggers were added to,
    so if you add tables later, you can simply run it again and it will just
    add the triggers where they are needed.

    * Alternately, you can add triggers yourself to the tables you want to
      track.

          CREATE TRIGGER table_version
          AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE
          ON my_table FOR EACH STATEMENT
          EXECUTE PROCEDURE versioning.update_table();

      You could also use the code for the update_triggers function as a
      basis for creating your own automatic setup function which follows your
      rules for determining what tables to add the triggers to.
